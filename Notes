Notes about Elixir:

- Always try to pre-append on lists/collections due to slow append for Elixir's linked lits structure.
- Modifying tuples is expensive and should not be done to often.
- Keyword lists always has an atom/symbol as key.
- In maps duplicates erase the previous value. Also has special syntax for only atom keys.
- Tuples are not enumerables. Hence, they cannot be used with Enum. functions.
- Inside a function reassignment can be done while still keeping its original value out of the scope.
