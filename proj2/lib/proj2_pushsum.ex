defmodule Proj2.PushSum do
  @moduledoc """
  Documentation for Proj2.PushSum
  
  Defines a push-sum implementation, which converges to the average value across all nodes.
  
  ## Gossip content
  
  Each node maintains a value and weight. When gossiping, the node divides its value and weight in half, and sends half to a neighbor.
  When gossip is received, it is added to the node's current value and weight.
  
  ## Convergence
  
  Each time a node receives a message, it compares the new sum/weight ratio with the previous ratio. If the ratio has not changed by more than 1e-11, the convergence counter is reset to 0. Otherwise, it is incremented. When the convergence counter reaches a limit, the node converges. This limit is specified in the pushsum: :count configuration.
  
  To prevent nodes from converging before receiving any messages, set the intial ratio to any value other than the actual starting v/w ratio.
