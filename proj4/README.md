# Project 4.1
A project in the course Distributed Operating System Principles COP5615. The task for this project was to implement the Bitcoin protocol with sufficient functionality to receve, send, and mine the digital currency that is Bitcoin. Futhermore, tests were implemented to test the correctness of each task.

## Installation
Download the project zip to your desired location and unzip. Make sure you have Elixir/Erlang installed on your computer and that it is in the OS path for easy command access.

## Running the bitcoin tests
To run the tests, change directory into `/proj4/` and write the following test calls to test independent correctness of bitcoin functionality. Please refer to the test source code for further test specific details.

#### Transaction test

#### Merkle Tree test
The merkle tree test concerns the testing of functionality when creating a merkle tree as well as proof verifications and failures. This test module defines 5 tests in total. To run independent merkle tree tests, use the following command for executing the test script:
```sh
$ mix test test/Proj4/merkle_tree.exs
```
Refer to the file `test/Proj4/merkle_tree.exs` for further specification on the merkle tree test.
#### Block test
