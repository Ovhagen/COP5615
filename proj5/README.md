## Phoenix Setup

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create your database with `mix ecto.create`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

In the application you can see various statistics and metrics collected from a live simulation of the bitcoin protocol.
